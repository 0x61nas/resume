# Summary

I have been passionate about computers and technology since a young age.
With proficiency in various programming languages and technologies, I
have demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to new languages and
techniques quickly.  

My professional experience spans both software engineering and IT
industries, where I have successfully applied my skills to develop and
implement innovative solutions. I am particularly interested in
leveraging my programming expertise to create a positive, real-world
impact. I firmly believe that one line of code has the potential to
drive significant change.  

Additionally, I am deeply committed to the Linux and open-source
communities, consistently contributing to and supporting various
projects within these ecosystems. My technical expertise includes
proficiency in Rust, Python, and Java and experience with frameworks
such as Actix, FastAPI, and Spring Boot. I am also adept at using tools
like Git, Docker, and Nix, and I have extensive experience with Linux
distributions, including Arch Linux and NixOS.

communicate with computers. I’m continuously refining my vision of the
perfect programming language, waiting for the right moment to bring it
to life.  
**Reverse Engineering**: Well... nothing is closed-source if you can
read assembly ;)
